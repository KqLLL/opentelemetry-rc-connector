## Description

Rc Connector is a connector component that will parse the SQL statements in the Span and add properties to the Span. The connector component exports span data to Datadog APM.

## Usage

To use the Rc Connector, add the connector to one set of the duplicated pipelines while sampling the other. The Connector will compute APM Stats on all spans that it sees.:

```yaml
# ...
connectors:
    # add the "Rc" connector definition and further configurations
  rcconnector:

exporters:
  datadog:
    api:
      key: ${env:DD_API_KEY}

service:
  pipelines:
   traces:
     receivers: [otlp]
     processors: [batch]
     exporters: [rcconnector]

   traces/2: # this pipeline uses sampling
     receivers: [rcconnector]
     processors: [batch]
     exporters: [datadog]
```
